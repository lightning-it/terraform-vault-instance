# Engineering agent contract

This repository publishes the public Vault Terraform module. Treat
`.lit/repository.yml`, `RELEASE.md`, `TESTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and the accepted
Lightning IT Engineering ADRs as the governing repository contract.

- Work through a pull request into `develop`; promote reviewed `develop` to `main`.
- Run Terraform formatting, initialization with the reviewed lock file, validation,
  documentation checks, and semantic-release dry-run checks.
- Never commit Terraform state, provider credentials, Vault tokens, plans containing
  secrets, or generated private material.
- Keep provider and external GitHub Action references reviewed and immutable.
- Preserve managed-file headers and change shared policy at
  `lightning-it/shared-assets-lit`.
- Run `python3 scripts/lit-push-ready.py push-ready` before pushing.
- Required remote checks and branch protection must not be bypassed.
- ADR 70 temporarily allows zero human/CODEOWNER approvals and separately
  documented protected-environment self-approval for immutable exact-SHA
  plan/apply evidence; it does not allow PR self-review or check bypass.

## REP-60 current-revision review governance

- Local validation is deterministic only. It must never invoke Codex, GitHub
  Copilot, another model, or an external AI endpoint. Authoritative AI review
  runs only in the protected GitHub pipeline and binds the exact PR head.
- Lightning IT automation may request and fund one GitHub Copilot review only
  when the exact PR author is `litroc`, and only at the finalization boundary;
  intermediate `synchronize` pushes must not trigger AI review. Any finding
  requires correction and a final current-head re-review. The request is
  consumed once per head; unavailable or quota-blocked reviews fail closed
  without an automatic retry. Organization-funded Codex remediation and its
  single re-review are likewise restricted to `litroc`.
- Every other human or external contributor supplies any required current-head
  Copilot review under their own entitlement and cost. Lightning IT verifies
  valid evidence but never requests or funds that review, and personal tokens or
  provider keys never enter Actions.
- A same-repository PR authored exactly by
  `lightning-it-release-automation[bot]` uses only the protected MLX-90 §7.2
  Exact-Revision Codex check. It must never request Copilot or synthesize a
  Copilot success.
- A proven ancestry-only main-to-develop backmerge uses the deterministic
  evidence-bound exemption and performs zero AI calls. Unknown automation
  identities fail closed.
- The only neutral merge-gate result is `Current revision review`. Missing,
  stale, ambiguous, or unresolved review evidence blocks the merge.

<!-- LIT REP-60 evidence lifecycle: start -->

### REP-60 evidence lifecycle (mandatory)

- Every pull request into `develop` retains its exact-final-head native GitHub
  CI, required-check, and review history as the authoritative evidence for
  acceptance into `develop`.
- A pull request into `develop` MUST NOT create or retain an additional durable
  release-evidence package, duplicate WORM artifact, or second AI-review
  evidence outside that native GitHub history.
- Only the protected `develop` to `main` promotion creates exactly one durable,
  complete release-evidence package. It binds the full integrated promotion
  diff, base, head, merge base, integration tree, policy, reviewer result, and
  all release and audit checks.
- Agents, workflows, and repository-local rules MUST NOT duplicate that durable
  evidence per `develop` pull request or invoke local AI to create evidence.
  Repository-local rules may only make this lifecycle stricter.

<!-- LIT Devtools container governance: start -->

## Devtools container execution boundary

- Every deterministic lint, format, type-check, test, build, packaging,
  policy, and validation workload runs in the digest-pinned Lightning IT
  Devtools image, locally and in CI. Host-language runtimes never provide
  acceptance evidence.
- The host boundary is limited to Git, the supported container engine, and the
  centrally managed Devtools, push-ready, and pre-commit dispatchers. A
  dispatcher may inspect Git state and start the pinned container, but it must
  not execute a repository validator through host Python, Node.js, Ansible,
  Ruff, a Python type checker, markdownlint, Renovate, or a comparable host
  runtime.
- If a required command or compatible version is absent, fail closed. Add and
  pin it in `container-ee-wunder-devtools-ubi9`, release that image normally,
  update the centrally managed digest, and rerun the gate. Host fallbacks,
  ad-hoc virtual environments, and unpinned helper images are forbidden.
- Repository-owned tests derive the exact full Devtools image reference from
  the centrally managed push-ready engine when checking the installed wrapper;
  they never hard-code an independent release tag that can drift during a
  normal image rollout.
- Defaults stay read-only, offline, socket-free, capability-dropped, and
  non-privileged. A gate may opt into only its explicit tested minimum. Linked
  Git metadata remains read-only and container Git may trust only
  `/workspace`, never `*`. Executable temporary fixtures use the isolated
  container home while generic `/tmp` remains non-executable.
- The Devtools boundary never makes local Codex, Copilot, or other model calls
  and never receives personal AI credentials.

<!-- LIT AI task governance: start -->

## AI model and token governance

Apply `LIT-GEN-GDR-GOV-30-Budget-Conscious-AI-Model-Selection` to every
substantive Codex or ChatGPT-assisted task. Before investigation, planning, tool
use, implementation, or delegation, record a compact task profile in the task
chat: work item, risk (`low`, `normal`, or `high`), smallest sufficient
model/reasoning choice, rationale, and a concrete escalation condition.

- Use the balanced, lowest reliable capability by default. Escalate to a
  premium/frontier model or higher reasoning only for a high-risk decision,
  complex architecture/debugging/dependencies, or a documented focused failure
  of the standard approach. Restrict that escalation to the difficult subtask.
- Never use Speed Mode. Do not replace verification with a more expensive model
  or sacrifice quality to reduce elapsed time.
- Retrieve only relevant issue, files, logs, and source records; avoid broad
  repository or chat-history loading, speculative analysis, and unbounded retry
  loops. Delegate only independent, bounded work that reduces total effort.
- For GitHub or Jira work, include the task profile in the issue/task record
  when AI assistance materially affects execution. Close with verification and
  remaining risks; preserve durable decisions in Confluence, Jira, or GitHub.
